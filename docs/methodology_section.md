# METHODOLOGY

## Study Design and Dataset

This study employed a cross-sectional analysis of speech biomarkers for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) using the Extended Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of Oz (E-DAIC-WOZ) dataset. The E-DAIC-WOZ is a publicly available corpus containing clinical interviews designed to support the diagnosis of psychological distress conditions, particularly depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

## Participants

The dataset comprised 212 participants recruited through clinical and community settings. Participants were categorized into two groups based on their depression status:
- **MDD group**: 67 participants (31.6%) meeting criteria for Major Depressive Disorder
- **Control group**: 145 participants (68.4%) without current MDD diagnosis

### Demographic Characteristics
- **Age**: Mean 39.6 ± 12.2 years (range: 18-70 years)
- **Gender distribution**: 117 males (55.2%), 95 females (44.8%)
- **MDD prevalence by gender**: 
  - Males: 30/117 (25.6%)
  - Females: 37/95 (38.9%)

Depression severity was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), with MDD participants showing mean scores of 14.3 ± 3.4 (males) and 14.5 ± 4.0 (females).

## Speech Feature Extraction

Speech features were extracted from clinical interview recordings and organized into four primary categories:

### 1. Lexical Richness Features (n=7)
Measures of vocabulary diversity and complexity:
- Type-Token Ratio (TTR)
- Root TTR
- Corrected TTR  
- Honoré statistic
- Maas index
- Moving Average TTR
- Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD)

### 2. Syntactic Complexity Features (n=8)
Indicators of grammatical sophistication:
- Mean length of utterance
- Mean length of T-unit
- Mean number of clauses per T-unit
- Mean number of complex T-units per T-unit
- Mean number of coordinate phrases per T-unit
- Mean number of subordinate clauses per T-unit
- Proportion of complex T-units
- Proportion of verb phrases with objects

### 3. Word Type and Sentiment Features (n=8)
Linguistic and emotional content measures:
- Noun rate
- Verb rate
- Adjective rate
- Proper noun rate
- Inflected verb rate
- Mean sentiment score
- Positive sentence ratio
- Negative sentence ratio
- Neutral sentence ratio

### 4. Repetition and Disfluency Features (n=4)
Speech pattern irregularities:
- Number of consecutive repetitions
- Number of non-consecutive repetitions  
- Number of restarts
- Number of repairs

## Statistical Analysis

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Missing data handling**: 
   - Cases with missing PHQ-8 scores excluded from analysis
   - Missing speech features imputed using median imputation
   - Implementation: `pandas.DataFrame.fillna(df.median())`

2. **Outlier detection and treatment**: 
   - Extreme values identified as >3 standard deviations from mean
   - RobustScaler used for feature scaling to minimize outlier influence
   - No outliers removed; robust statistical methods employed instead

3. **Feature standardization**: 
   - All speech features standardized using RobustScaler
   - Implementation: `sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler()`
   - Formula: X_scaled = (X - median(X)) / IQR(X)
   - Rationale: More robust to outliers than z-score standardization

4. **Binary encoding**: 
   - MDD diagnosis converted to binary variable (0 = Control, 1 = MDD)
   - Gender encoded as binary variable (0 = Male, 1 = Female)
   - Used for stratification in train-test splits and cross-validation

### Primary Analysis: Depression Prediction
Multiple analytical approaches were employed to examine the relationship between speech features and depression severity:

#### Correlation Analysis
- **Pearson correlation coefficients** calculated between each speech feature and PHQ-8 scores
- **Multiple comparisons correction**: 
  - Bonferroni correction applied: α = 0.05/27 = 0.0019
  - Rationale: Control family-wise error rate across 27 simultaneous tests
- **Effect sizes interpreted** using Cohen's conventions:
  - Small: r ≥ 0.1, Medium: r ≥ 0.3, Large: r ≥ 0.5
- **Implementation**: `scipy.stats.pearsonr()` for correlation and p-value computation
- **Significance levels**: 
  - p < 0.001: *** (highly significant)
  - p < 0.01: ** (very significant)  
  - p < 0.05: * (significant)

#### Machine Learning Models
Five supervised learning algorithms were implemented and systematically compared:

1. **Linear Regression**: 
   - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) baseline model
   - Implementation: `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()`
   - No regularization applied

2. **Ridge Regression**: 
   - L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
   - Hyperparameters tested: α ∈ {1.0, 10.0}
   - Implementation: `sklearn.linear_model.Ridge(alpha=α)`
   - Regularization term: λ∑βᵢ²

3. **Lasso Regression**: 
   - L1 regularization for feature selection
   - Hyperparameters tested: α ∈ {0.1, 1.0}
   - Implementation: `sklearn.linear_model.Lasso(alpha=α)`
   - Regularization term: λ∑|βᵢ|

4. **Elastic Net**: 
   - Combined L1/L2 regularization
   - Parameters: α = 1.0, l1_ratio = 0.5 (equal weighting of L1 and L2 penalties)
   - Implementation: `sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet(alpha=1.0, l1_ratio=0.5)`
   - Regularization term: λ₁∑|βᵢ| + λ₂∑βᵢ²

5. **Random Forest**: 
   - Ensemble method with bootstrap aggregating
   - Parameters: n_estimators = 100, random_state = 42
   - Implementation: `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor()`
   - Feature importance computed via mean decrease impurity

#### Model Evaluation
- **Cross-validation**: 
  - 5-fold Stratified K-Fold cross-validation
  - Implementation: `sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)`
  - Stratification by depression status (MDD vs. Control) to ensure balanced folds
  - Scoring metric: R² (coefficient of determination)

- **Train-test split**: 
  - 80% training, 20% testing
  - Implementation: `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=MDD_binary)`
  - Stratification ensures proportional representation of MDD cases in both sets

- **Performance metrics**: 
  - **R² (coefficient of determination)**: Proportion of variance explained
  - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: √(Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²/n)
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Σ|yᵢ - ŷᵢ|/n
  - Calculated for both training and testing sets

- **Feature scaling**: 
  - **RobustScaler** applied to all features before modeling
  - Implementation: `sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler()`
  - Rationale: More robust to outliers than StandardScaler
  - Formula: (X - median(X)) / IQR(X)

### Gender Differences Analysis

A comprehensive gender-stratified analysis was conducted, adapting methodology from established PTSD gender differences research:

#### Sample Stratification
- Analysis restricted to MDD participants only (n=67)
- Male MDD: n=30, Female MDD: n=37
- Sufficient power (>80%) for detecting medium-to-large effect sizes

#### Statistical Tests for Group Differences
1. **Mann-Whitney U tests**: 
   - Non-parametric comparison of speech features between male and female MDD participants
   - Alternative hypothesis: two-sided
   - Implementation: `scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu()` with `alternative='two-sided'`
   
2. **Effect size calculation**: 
   - Cohen's d computed as: d = (μ₁ - μ₂) / σ_pooled
   - Pooled standard deviation: σ_pooled = √[((n₁-1)σ₁² + (n₂-1)σ₂²) / (n₁+n₂-2)]
   - Interpretation: Small (d = 0.2), Medium (d = 0.5), Large (d = 0.8)
   
3. **Multiple comparisons correction**: 
   - Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure
   - Implementation: `statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests()` with `method='fdr_bh'`
   - Significance threshold: q < 0.05

#### Gender-Specific Correlation Analysis
1. **Spearman rank correlations**: 
   - Examined associations between speech features and PHQ-8 scores separately for each gender
   - Implementation: `scipy.stats.spearmanr()`
   - Rationale: Non-parametric approach robust to outliers and non-linear relationships
   
2. **Statistical significance**: 
   - FDR-corrected p-values using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
   - Significance threshold: adjusted p < 0.05
   
3. **Correlation strength interpretation**: 
   - Weak: |ρ| < 0.3, Moderate: 0.3 ≤ |ρ| < 0.7, Strong: |ρ| ≥ 0.7

#### Interaction Effects Analysis
- **Linear regression models**: 
  - Model: PHQ-8 ~ Feature + Gender + Feature×Gender
  - Implementation: `statsmodels.api.OLS()` with interaction terms
  - Outcome variable: PHQ-8 depression severity (continuous)
  - Predictors: Standardized speech features, gender (binary), interaction terms
- **Statistical significance**: FDR-corrected p-values for interaction terms (q < 0.05)

## Ethical Considerations

This study utilized a publicly available, de-identified dataset. All participants in the original E-DAIC-WOZ collection provided informed consent for research use. The current analysis was conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for secondary data analysis.

## Sample Size and Power Analysis

Post-hoc power analysis indicated sufficient statistical power (>80%) for:
- Detecting medium-to-large correlations (r ≥ 0.3) in the full sample
- Identifying large effect sizes (d ≥ 0.8) in gender comparisons
- Medium effect sizes (d ≥ 0.5) in gender-stratified correlations

The relatively modest sample sizes in gender subgroups (n=30-37) provided adequate power for detecting clinically meaningful associations while acknowledging limitations for small effect sizes.
